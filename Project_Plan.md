# ðŸ“Œ Project Plan: Cloudflare DNS Automation & Security Enforcement

## 1. Setup
- Create a Cloudflare account (if you don't already have one).
- Get your Cloudflare API Token with permissions for:
  - DNS Management
  - Firewall (WAF) Management
  - Monitoring/Analytics Access

## 2. Automation: DNS Management
- Write a script (Python is a good choice) that uses Cloudflare's API to:
  - Create DNS records (A, CNAME, TXT, etc.).
  - Update DNS records automatically when IPs or configs change.
  - Delete old DNS records if needed.
- Example tools: Python `requests` library or `cloudflare` Python package.

## 3. Security: WAF and Rate Limiting
- Use API calls to:
  - Set WAF rules (e.g., block bad bots, restrict countries, etc.).
  - Apply Rate Limiting policies (e.g., max 10 requests/second per IP).
- Make security rules automated so new domains/subdomains get protected instantly.

## 4. Monitoring: DNS and Security Compliance
- Schedule regular checks (cron jobs or GitHub Actions) to:
  - Confirm all expected DNS records are present and healthy.
  - Confirm WAF and Rate Limiting are active for each zone.
- Alert (email, Slack, etc.) if:
  - A DNS record is missing or wrong.
  - WAF settings are changed or missing.
  - Anomalies are detected in traffic patterns.

## 5. (Optional) Dashboard or Report
- Create a simple dashboard (could be a web page or emailed report) that shows:
  - Current DNS records.
  - Status of WAF and rate-limiting protections.
  - Any warnings or issues.
