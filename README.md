# 📄 Cloudflare DNS Automation & Security Enforcement

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates DNS record management using the Cloudflare API while enforcing important security practices. It automatically handles creating, updating, and deleting DNS records, applies Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules and rate-limiting protections, and monitors DNS settings to ensure everything stays compliant and secure.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Automate DNS record management (create, update, delete) via Cloudflare API.
- Apply WAF (Web Application Firewall) rules to block bad traffic.
- Set up rate-limiting to prevent abuse and attacks.
- Monitor DNS health and security rules automatically.
- Alert when something is wrong or needs attention.

## 📚 Project Glossary (Simple Explanations)

- **Cloudflare**: A company that helps websites load faster and stay safe by providing services like DNS, firewall, and protection against attacks.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)**: It is like the internet’s phone book that turns website names (like google.com) into IP addresses computers can understand.
- **Automation**: Making tasks happen automatically with scripts or tools, without needing a human to do them by hand.
- **Security**: Protecting websites and servers from hackers, bad traffic, or any kind of attack.
- **Enforcement**: Making sure that security rules are always applied and followed without forgetting or skipping.
- **Cloudflare API**: A set of tools that lets your code talk to Cloudflare automatically to create, change, or delete things like DNS records and security settings.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: A security tool that checks traffic coming to your website and blocks anything dangerous like hacking attempts.
- **Rate-Limiting**: A way to control how many times a user or system can send requests to your website in a short time, to stop spamming or attacks.
- **DNS Monitoring**: Watching your DNS records regularly to make sure they are correct and have not been changed or attacked.
- **Compliance**: Following certain security rules or standards to make sure your system stays safe and trusted.

## 🔧 How to Set Up

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Cloudflare-DNS-Automation.git
   cd Cloudflare-DNS-Automation
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set your Cloudflare API credentials inside `config.yaml`.

5. Run scripts to automate, enforce security, and monitor.

## 📢 Important Notes
- Always keep your `config.yaml` secret. It contains your API tokens.
- Never upload your API tokens to GitHub.
- Regularly check monitoring reports and logs to stay updated on DNS and security health.
